# Predicting-CO2-Emissions
Analyzing/Predicting CO2 emissions by vehicles with different features

1) Scrapped model-specific vehicle data for over 10 years from the Govt. of Canadaâ€™s open data website and performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature engineering.

2) Curated a multivariate regression model using group LASSO and heavyLm to predict CO2 emissions. The model was able to forecast CO2 emissions with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 19.29 grams/kilometer and could be useful in implementing federal regulations to combat climate change.
